    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A chocolate stout cake is a type of cake that is made with stout beer,
      such as Guinness, and cocoa powder, giving it a rich and moist texture and
      a deep chocolate flavor. The stout beer also enhances the sweetness and
      complexity of the cake, and adds a slight bitterness that balances the
      sugar. A chocolate stout cake can be frosted with various toppings, such
      as chocolate ganache, buttercream, whipped cream, or cream cheese
      frosting. Some recipes also add Irish cream liqueur to the frosting, to
      create a contrast between the dark cake and the light frosting, and to
      echo the Irish origin of the stout beer. A chocolate stout cake is a
      decadent and delicious dessert that is perfect for celebrating special
      occasions, such as St. Patrick&apos;s Day, birthdays, or anniversaries.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and prepare your cake pans.</li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, melt the butter and stout beer together, then whisk in
        the sugar and cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sour cream, and vanilla extract
        together, then add the stout mixture and whisk until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together, then
        add to the wet ingredients and stir until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or
        until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>Let the cakes cool completely on a wire rack before frosting.</li>
      <li>
        To make the frosting, chop the chocolate and place it in a heatproof
        bowl. Heat the cream in a saucepan until simmering, then pour over the
        chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in the vanilla extract
        and refrigerate until thick enough to spread.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using Irish cream liqueur, whip it with some butter and powdered
        sugar until fluffy and smooth
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the cake, trim the tops of the cake layers if needed, then
        place one layer on a serving plate. Spread some frosting over the top,
        then repeat with the remaining layers. Frost the sides and top of the
        cake with the remaining frosting, and decorate as desired.
