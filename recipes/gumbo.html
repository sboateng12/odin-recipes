    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Gumbo is a traditional Cajun dish that originated in Louisiana. It is a
      hearty stew that consists of a dark roux, a mixture of flour and oil that
      gives the gumbo its rich flavor and color, and a variety of meats and
      vegetables. The most common meats are chicken, andouille sausage, and
      shrimp, but some versions also include crab, oysters, or duck. The
      vegetables include the holy trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper, as
      well as garlic, parsley, thyme, and bay leaves. Some gumbo recipes also
      add okra, tomatoes, or filé powder, a spice made from dried sassafras
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make gumbo, you need to cook the roux over medium-low heat, stirring
      constantly, until it reaches a deep brown color. This can take up to an
      hour, but it is worth the effort. Then, you add the chopped vegetables and
      cook until soft. Next, you add the chicken broth, the seasonings, and the
      meats, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the
      gumbo until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors are well
      blended. Finally, you add the shrimp and cook for a few more minutes until
      they turn pink. Serve the gumbo over hot cooked rice, with some crusty
      bread and hot sauce on the side. Enjoy!

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the roux. In a large pot, combine flour and oil and cook, stirring
        constantly on medium low heat, until it reaches a dark brown color. This
        can take up to an hour, but it is worth the effort.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the veggies. Chop celery, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and garlic.
        You can also add okra, if you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown the sausage. In a large skillet, cook the sausage slices over high
        heat until browned on both sides. Drain the excess fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add to the pot. Add chicken broth, veggies, parsley, and roux to the pot
        and stir well. Season with Cajun seasoning, sugar, hot sauce, bay
        leaves, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for
        about an hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors
        are well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the seafood. Add the shrimp and crab meat and cook for a few more
        minutes until the shrimp turn pink. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and
        vinegar. Adjust the seasonings to your taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve over rice. Ladle the gumbo into bowls and serve over hot cooked
        rice. Enjoy!
